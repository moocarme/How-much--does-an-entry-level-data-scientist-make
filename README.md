# How much does an entry level data scientist make

This tableau workbook uses data source from the US Department of Laborâ€™s Office of Foreign Labor Certification (http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm) to find statistics on the paid wage per year that data scientists receive.
The workbook focuses on states that have a higher cost of living as that's where data scientists like to hang out (New York city, San Francisco, Austin, Boston etc)
