# How much does an entry level data scientist make

This tableau workbook uses data source from the US Department of Laborâ€™s Office of Foreign Labor Certification that can be found [here](http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm), to explore statistics on the paid wage per year that data scientists receive.
The workbook focuses on states that have a higher cost of living as that's where data scientists like to hang out (New York city, San Francisco, Austin, Boston etc).

The dashboard for the workbook can be found at [here]( https://public.tableau.com/profile/matthew.moocarme#!/vizhome/HowMuchDoesADataScientistMake/Dashboard1).

Overall I found that the median wage for an entry-level data scientists in a tech-centric city was **$114,669**.
